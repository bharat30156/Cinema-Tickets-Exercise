# Cinema Tickets Exercise

## Description

This repository contains my solution to the coding exercise provided by Department for Work and Pension for the role of Java Software Engineer. I have built a Java application that implements a TicketService, addressing the given business rules, constraints, and assumptions. The objective of this exercise is to demonstrate my coding skills, approach to problem-solving, and ability to write clean, well-tested, and reusable code.

## Key Instructions

- The solution is written in Java 17.
- The code adheres to the provided business rules for ticket types and prices.
- A TicketPaymentService is implemented for handling payments.
- A SeatReservationService is implemented for reserving seats.
- The TicketService interface is not modified, as per the constraints.
- The TicketTypeRequest object is designed as immutable.

## Ticket Types and Prices

- INFANT: £0
- CHILD: £10
- ADULT: £20

## Constraints and Assumptions

- Third-party packages cannot be modified.
- Valid accounts have sufficient funds.
- External services (TicketPaymentService and SeatReservationService) have no defects.
- Payment and seat reservation are assumed to work flawlessly.

## Objective

This repository serves as my response to DWP coding exercise, showcasing my ability to implement a TicketService adhering to the provided criteria. The code is well-documented, tested, and designed to meet the specified business rules.

Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback. Thank you for considering my application!
